# RobotCombatOverlay
Arena and stream display for robot combat events

## To Use
Import `websocket server.json` into Node Red. Deploy to create a websocket server allowing communication between `overlay.html` and `controls.html`. Open `overlay.html` as a browser source in OBS. Use `controls.html` to control it. Running the HTML files as local files *should* work, but if not, I've been running it using the Live Server extension in VS Code

## Broker Information

This stack is intended to use Mosquitto, the Apache broker.  It can be installed on Windows or Linux, as well as macOS.  The configuration file that this setup expects and uses is as follows:
```
allow_anonymous true

listener 1883
protocol mqtt

listener 9001
protocol websockets
```

## Notes
This is very much a work in progress. There's enough here that I'm comfortable saying I can have v1 working this weekend. The background image on the overlay is just there so I have something to simulate the effect of putting the overlay over a video of the arena.

## Next
For January event:
* Better styling
* Read robots from an external source (probably the Google Sheet that Kristen is using for check-in)
* Implement timer (hopefully triggered by arena control, otherwise a button to stop and start)
* Add selection for which round of the tournament we're in
* Add robot pictures (hopefully)

## Other goals
* Control overlay from OBS *or* control OBS from control page for overlay
* More convenient setup
* Better communication with arena
